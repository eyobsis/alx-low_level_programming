# 0x14. C - Bit Manipulation

This project is part of the low-level programming curriculum and aims to teach how to manipulate bits and use bitwise operators in C language. By the end of this project, you should be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google, how to look for the right source of information and how to manipulate bits.

## Learning Objectives
- Look for the right source of information without too much help
- Manipulate bits and use bitwise operators
- Use the Betty style for your code
- Do not use global variables
- Use no more than 5 functions per file
- Use only the C standard library functions malloc, free, and exit. Don't use functions like printf, puts, calloc, realloc, etc.
- Use _putchar
- Create your own main.c files to test your functions (but don't push them to your repo)
- Include prototypes of all your functions and the function _putchar in your header file called main.h
- Use include guards for all your header files

## Files
The following files are required to complete this project:
- `main.h`: Header file containing all function prototypes and struct definitions
- `0-binary_to_uint.c`: A function that converts a binary number to an unsigned int
- `1-print_binary.c`: A function that prints the binary representation of a number
- `2-get_bit.c`: A function that returns the value of a bit at a given index
- `3-set_bit.c`: A function that sets the value of a bit to 1 at a given index
- `4-clear_bit.c`: A function that sets the value of a bit to 0 at a given index
- `5-flip_bits.c`: A function that returns the number of bits needed to be flipped to get from one number to another
- `100-get_endianness.c`: A function that checks the endianness of the system
- `101-password`: paaswordfile
All files should be compiled using `gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic *.c` and your code should pass all checks using `betty-style.pl` and `betty-doc.pl`.
